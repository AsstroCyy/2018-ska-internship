### Step 1

Access http://202.127.29.56/ska/2018-ska-Internship or https://github.com/SHAO-SKA/2018-ska-internship, then **Fork** to your own repo, here I support your username is *hello*. **Please replace hello by your own name in the following operations**

### Step 2

You should first clone this repo in method 1 or 2, both works.
